\begin{abstract}
    Using geometric programming, a comparison of solar-electric and gas powered, long-endurance aircraft is accomplished.
    Long-endurance aircraft present a complicated systems engineering problem because of the multifaceted interaction of various requirements, such as endurance, velocity and coverage footprint.
    Geometric programming, a form of convex optimization, can reliably solve problems with thousands of variables in seconds and is used as an optimization tool to evaluate the design trade offs between architectures and requirements.
    Using this approach, a gas powered and a solar-electric powered aircraft were considered.  
    The results show that long-endurance, gas powered aircraft are generally more robust to higher wind speeds than solar-powered aircraft.  
    However, gas powered aircraft are limited in their endurance by the amount of fuel that they can carry. 
    While solar-electric powered aircraft can theoretically fly for months, they are operationally limited by limited sunlight during the winter and wind speeds at higher latitudes.
    Using geometric programming, a detailed trade study between gas-powered and solar-powered aircraft is performed to discover which architecture is best suited to meet a given set of requirements, and what is the optimum size and endurance of that platform.

\section{Introduction}

The design problem of a long-endurance, station-keeping aircraft is considered.
Solar electric and gas powered architectures are proposed as solutions to this problem.
Because sizing long-endurance aircraft is so multifaceted and the interaction between aerodynamics, structural weight, energy and other disciplines is so intertwined, a systematic and rapid approach is needed to explore this design space.
Geometric programming, a form of convex optimization, is chosen as a means of evalulating the design space because of its ability to solve optimization problems involving thousands of variables in seconds.  

The driving condition that sizes solar-electric powered aircraft is operationality or the ability to operate at multiple locations and during all seasons.  
To achieve a feasible design, solar-electric powered aircraft must carry enouh solar cells and batteries required to fly during the day while storing enough energy to fly through the night. 
If this condition can be achieved during the winter solstice, when the solar flux is at a minimum, then it can theoretically fly for months at a time. 
This becomes more difficult to achieve at higher latitudes as the solar flux durin the winter solstice decreases.  
Additionally, to station keep the aircraft must fly faster than the local wind speeds.  
Wind speeds are a function of latitude, altitude, and season and tend to increase at higher latitudes and during winter months. 
Therefore, a key sizing study of solar-electric powered aircraft is the effect of latitude on aircraft size.  
Figure~\ref{f:bvslatsolar} shows that in order to fly at higher latitudes during the winter a larger aircraft is required. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{bvslatsolar.pdf}
    \caption{ \textbf{ Trade study showing how aircraft size increases with latitude.  }}
	\label{f:bvslatsolar}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The key driving requirement for gas-powered aircraft is endurance.  
As gas-powered aircraft are endurance limited by the amount of fuel that they can carry, longer endurance requires more fuel and hence a larger aircraft.  
Becuase gas-powered aircraft are not affected by the solar flux, their station-keeping ability at different latitude only depends on wind speed. 
Therefore, if a gas-powered aircraft can fly at the latitude with the worst wind speed in can theortically fly anywhere else in the world.  
The key sizing study for the gas-powered airctaft is how weight increases for longer endurance. (Figure~\ref{f:mtowvsendurance}) 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{mtowvsendurance.pdf}
    \caption{ \textbf{ Trade study showing how aircraft weight increases with endurance.  }}
	\label{f:mtowvsendurance}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

To capture the interaction of all of these parameters and requirements and produce the resutls presented, a geometric programming optimization model is built for both the gas and solar-electric powered, long-endurance aircraft.  
Equations governing the underlying physics of aerodynamic performance, solar energy collection and storage, and fuel burn are written in a geometric programming form which can then be solved as an optimization problem.
Then by changing the design parameters, such as endurance, latitude, and percentile wind speeds, multiple solutions can be rapidly generated to observe how the aircraft size and weight is affected by different requirements. 

Using this methodology, trade offs are observed between different aircraft configurations, power sources, and requirements.  
The results show that gas-powered aircraft can generally be built lighter and can fly faster and can therefore fly at higher latitudes and in higher percentile wind speeds.  
Solar-powered aircraft have greater endurance but are limited operationally by their ability to reach higher speeds.  
This optimization methodology can quantify the difference in weight and endurance between and gas and solar-electric powered aircraft for the same set of requirements. 
Similar trade offs are calculated for other requirements and performance metrics to determine under what conditions which platform is best suited to meet a set of requirements.

\section{Geometric Programming\cite{gp}}

Geometric programs (GPs) are a mathematical optimization problem characterized by the convexity of the objective and constraint functions. GPs have the form

\begin{align} 
\label{e:gpform}
\text{minimize } f_0(\bold{x}) & \nonumber \\
\text{subject to  } f_i(\bold{x}) &\leq 1, i=1,...,m \\
g_i (\bold{x}) &= 1, i = 1,...,p \nonumber 
\end{align}

where the functions $f_i$ must be \emph{monomial} functions and the functions $g_i$ must be \emph{posynomial} functions. \emph{Monomials} and \emph{posynomials} have the forms

\begin{align}
 \label{e:mon}
g(\bold{x}) &= c x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \dotsm x_n^{a_n} , \\
\label{e:pos}
f(\bold{x}) &= \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^K c_k x_1^{a_{1_k}} x_2^{a_{2_k}} \dotsm x_n^{a_{n_k}}.
\end{align}

The properties of a geometric program allow solution algorithms to guarantee convergence to a global optimum, provided that there exists a feasible solution to the set of constraint functions.  
Additionally, geometric programs can be solved rapidly with existing algorithms.  
Using state of the art, standard interior-point algorithms, GPs with 1,000 variables and 10,000 constraints converge to a solution in tens of seconds.\cite{gp}  
To solve an aircraft design problem, all physical models are expressed as constraints on the GP.\cite{hoburgthesis} \\

\section{Aircraft Sizing Models}

To evaluate the size and performance of both gas and solar-electric powered aircraft basic physics models are used.  
Environmental models describing the effect of altitude, latitude and season on wind speeds, air density, and solar insolation and aircraft models governing the performance, aerodynamics and weight breakdown are used in the optimization model.
Equations from these models are then expressed in a GP-compatible form to enable their use in the optimization. 
Understanding the models that are used in a GP is important because the solution to a GP is only as accurate as the models that are used to construct the program.  
To obtain higher fidelity results from the optimization, higher fidelity models can be implemented. 

\subsection{Station Keeping}

Long-endurance, station keeping aircraft are generally required to operate at specific latitudes, altitudes, and percentile wind speeds. Both wind speeds and atmospheric quantities depend on the station keeping requirements. 

\subsubsection{Wind Speeds}

To station keep, an aircraft must fly faster than the wind speed.  
Therefore, the aircraft speed is constrained for both the gas and solar-electric powered cases,

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:availreq}
    V \geq V_{wind}.
\end{equation}

The wind speed at a station is a function of latitude, altitude, season or day of the year, and percentile wind speed,

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:windspeed}
    V_{wind} = f(\phi, h, DOY, \text{Percentile Wind Speed}).
    \end{equation}

Wind speed data was collected from the ERA Interim atmospheric datasets for the year 2015.\cite{wind} 
It is assumed that the wind speeds can be approximated by averaging over the entire year. (i.e. $V_{wind} = f(\phi, h, \text{Percentile Wind Speed})$) \\

Figure~\ref{f:windlat} shows how the wind speed varies with latitude. 
The wind profiles versus latitude show a maximum between 35-45 degrees latitude, depending on the altitude.  
The higher wind speeds at these latitudes impose a high constraint on the flight velocity for both gas and solar-electric powered aircraft.  \\

 \label{f:windlat}
\end{figure}

The wind profiles versus altitude show a local maximum around 35,000 ft and a local minimum around 60,000 ft. (Figure~\ref{f:windalt}) 
Solar-electric powered aircraft, that do not have aspirated engines, fly around 60,000 ft take advantage of lower wind speeds and limited cloud coverage.
Gas powered aircraft with aispirated engines can have difficulty operating at 60,000 ft and generally perform better in the lower wind speeds below 25,000 ft.

 \label{f:windalt}
\end{figure}

In the GP optimization, wind speed is calculated prior to solving the optimization as a function of latitude, altitude and percentile wind speed. 

\subsubsection{Atmospheric Quantities}

The altitude also determines the air density,\cite{density}

\begin{align}
    \label{e:Talt}
    T_{\text{atm}} = T_{\text{sl}} - Lh \\
    \label{e:rhot}
    \rho = \frac{T_{\text{sl}}T_{\text{atm}}^{\left( \frac{g}{R_{\text{spec}}L} -1 \right)}}{R T_{\text{sl}}^{\frac{g}{R_{\text{spec}}L}}}.
\end{align}

Air viscosity is assumed constant across all altitudes, $\mu=1e-5$ [k/m/s].

\subsection{Solar-Electric Power}

The driving equations for the solar-electric powered aircraft are determined by the energy required to fly throughout the day while charging the batteries enough to last through the night.  
Equations~\ref{e:solarreq} and~\ref{e:solarbatt} capture the solar requirement by enforcing that the total solar energy harvested by the solar cells during the day must be greater than the energy used to operate the aircraft during the day while charging enough batteries to fly during the night. 
Under these assumptions, if the aircraft can fly for one day and one night, then it could theoretically fly for many days under similar circumstances. 

    \begin{align}
        \label{e:solarreq}
        (E/S)_{\text{sun}} \eta_{\text{solar}} S_{\text{solar}} &\geq P_{\text{oper}}t_{\text{day}} + E_{\text{battery}}/\eta_{\text{charge}} \\
        \label{e:solarbatt}
        E_{\text{battery}} &\geq P_{\text{oper}}t_{\text{night}}/\eta_{\text{discharge}}
    \end{align}
    
    To enforce these constraints, two variables were created: $P_{\text{oper}}$ and $S_{\text{solar}}$. 
    $P_{\text{oper}}$ is defined as the average power required to operate the aircaft. \eqref{e:solarpoper} 
    $S_{\text{solar}}$ is defined as the amount of area on the aircraft covered by solar cells. \eqref{e:solarssolar}

    \begin{align}
        \label{e:solarpoper}
        P_{\text{oper}} &\geq P_{\text{shaft}} + P_{\text{avionics}} \\
        \label{e:solarssolar}
        S_{\text{solar}} &\leq f_{\text{solar}}S
    \end{align}

    For the purposes of this design study, it is assumed that the solar cells are only placed on the wing and that the total solar cell area is limited to some fraction of the wing planform area to account for control surfaces, leading edge, and other accessories.  \\

    Because solar aircraft requirements are typically given in terms if latitude and yearly availability it is useful to express the total available solar energy per unit area per day as a function of latitude, $\phi$, and the day of the year, $DOY$, 
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{e:solarfunc}
        (E/S)_{\text{sun}} = f(\phi, DOY).
    \end{equation}


    For simplicity, energy and power will refer to energy and power per unit area throughout the rest of this section. (i.e. $(E/S) = E$) The total available solar energy per day is an integral of the available solar power during the course of the day.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{e:solares}
        E_{\text{sun}} = \int_{t_{sunrise}}^{t_{sunset}} P_{\text{sun}} dt
    \end{equation}

    Figure~\ref{f:lat45} shows a sample distribution of the available solar power during the spring equinox at 45 degrees latitude. 
    
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{lat45.pdf}
    \caption{ \textbf{ The available solar power per unit area during the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere at $\phi=45^{\circ}$.  The area under this curve is the total energy available per unit area for the entire day.} }
	\label{f:lat45}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The shape of this curve is governed by the angle, $\theta$, between the normal to the flat surface, or aircraft wing, and the sun beam.\cite{solar}

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:solarp}
    P_{\text{sun}} = P_0 \cos{\theta}
\end{equation}

The angle, $\theta$ depends on the time of day, latitude, and declination angle,\cite{solar}

    \begin{equation}
        \label{e:solartheta}
        \cos{\theta} = \sin{\Delta} \sin{\phi} + \cos{\Delta} \cos{\phi} \cos{2\pi t/24},
    \end{equation}

    where $\Delta$ is the declination angle at solar noon, $\phi$ is the latitude, and $t$ is the time of day.\cite{solar}  The declination angle, $\Delta$,can be found using the relation\cite{solar} 

    \begin{align}
        \label{e:solardelta}
        \Delta = &0.006918 - 0.399912 \cos{\beta} + 0.070257\sin{\beta} - 0.006758\cos{2\beta} + \nonumber \\
        & 0.000907\sin{2\beta} - 0.002697\cos{3\beta} + 0.00148\sin{3\beta},
    \end{align}

    where, $\beta = 2\pi (DOY-1)/365$.  \\

    The time of day and the time of night can be calculated using a derivation Equation~\ref{e:solartheta}, \cite{solar}

    \begin{align}
        \label{e:solartday}
        \cos{(\pi t_{\text{sun rise}}/12)} &= -\tan{\Delta} \tan{\phi} \\
        \label{e:solarsunrise}
        t_{\text{sun rise}} &= -t_{\text{sun set}} \\
        \label{e:solartday2}
        t_{\text{day}} &= 2t_{\text{sun rise}} \\
        \label{e:solartnight}
        t_{\text{night}} &= 24 - t_{\text{day}}
    \end{align}

    where noon is $t=0$. Both $t_{\text{day}}$ and $t_{\text{night}}$ affect the battery size as defined in Equations~\ref{e:solarreq} and~\ref{e:solarbatt}. \\

    The solar power available assuming no inclination angle, $P_0$, is found using the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, 

    \begin{align}
        \label{e:solarp0}
        P_0 & = P_{\text{sun surface}} \frac{R_{\text{sun}}^2}{R_{\text{earth orbit}}^2}, \\
        \label{e:solareo}
        R_{\text{earth orbit}} & = r_0 \left[ 1 + 0.017 \sin{\left( 2\pi \frac{DOY-93}{365}\right)} \right],
    \end{align}
    
    where 

    \[ \begin{array}{lcl}
        P_{\text{sun surface}} & : & \text{Power emitted at the sun's surface} \\
        R_{\text{sun}} & : & \text{Radius of the sun} \\
        R_{\text{earth orbit}} & : & \text{Distance from earth to sun} \\
        r_0 & : & \text{Average distance from earth to sun} \\
        0.017 & : & \text{Eccentricity of earth-sun orbit}.
    \end{array} \]

    Using a trapezoidal integration of Equation~\ref{e:solares}, the total available solar energy per unit area can be obtained for a given latitude and day of the year. Because only Equations~\ref{e:solarreq}-\ref{e:solarssolar} are GP compatible, the total solar energy per unit area per day, the length of the day and the length of the night is calculated from the latitude and the day of the year prior to an optimization solve.

\subsection{Breguet Range}

A key sizing equation for a long endurance gas powered aircraft is the Breguet Range equation.  
For GP-compatibility and to optimize endurance, not range, a variation of the Breguet Range equation is used, 

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:breguetendurance}
    t = \frac{W_{\text{ave}}}{P_{\text{shaft}}BSFCg} \ln{\left( \frac{W_{\text{initial}}}{W_{\text{final}}}\right)}.
\end{equation}

The derivation begins with the differential form of Breguet Range,\cite{br2}

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:breguetdiff}
    -\frac{dW}{dt} = g\dot{m}_{\text{fuel}}.
\end{equation}

Using the definition of $BSFC$

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:brBSFC}
    BSFC = \frac{\dot{m}_{\text{fuel}}}{P_{\text{shaft}}},
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{e:breguetdiff} can be written as

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:brdiff2}
    -dW = g P_{\text{shaft}} BSFC dt.
\end{equation}

It is assumed that $BSFC$ and the power to weight ratio, $(P_{\text{shaft}}/W)$, are constant during the considered flight segment. 
A constant power to weight ratio assumes constant velocity and constant lift coefficient.\cite{br2}
Dividing by $W$,

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:brdiff2}
    -\frac{dW}{W} = \frac{g P_{\text{shaft}}BSFC }{W} dt,
\end{equation}

and integrating, the Breguet Range equation can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:be1}
    \ln{\left( \frac{W_{\text{initial}}}{W_{\text{final}}} \right)} = \frac{gP_{\text{shaft}}BSFC}{W_{\text{ave}}} t,
\end{equation}

where $W_{\text{ave}}$ is the average weight of the aircraft during the flight segment.  $W_{\text{ave}}$ is assumed to be the geometric mean, defined as

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:gpmean}
    W_{\text{ave}} = \sqrt{W_{\text{initial}}W_{\text{final}}}.
\end{equation}

    To make Equation~\ref{e:be1} GP compatible, a Taylor expansion of the exponentiated right hand side is used,\cite{hoburgthesis}

\begin{align}
    \label{e:brzbre}
    z_{bre} &\geq \frac{P_{\text{shaft}}t BSFC g}{W}\\
    \label{e:brtaylor}
    \frac{W_{\text{fuel}}}{W_{final}} &\geq z_{bre} + \frac{z_{bre}^2}{2} + \frac{z_{bre}^3}{6} + \frac{z_{bre}^4}{24} + \dots
\end{align}

    Equations~\ref{e:brzbre} and~\ref{e:brtaylor} are monomial and posynmial respectively and therefore GP compatible. \\
    
    For long-endurance aircraft, missions can last days, causing the power to weight ratio $(P_{\text{shaft}}/W)$ to vary significantly during the course of the flight.  Equations~\ref{e:brzbre},~\ref{e:brtaylor}, and~\ref{e:slfweight} can be discretized for more accurate results.

\begin{align}
    \label{e:slfweightd}
    \sqrt{W_i W_{i+1}} &= \frac{1}{2} \rho_i V_i^2 C_{L_i} S \\
    \label{e:brzbred}
    z_{bre_i} &\geq \frac{P_{shaft_i}t_i BSFC g}{\sqrt{W_i W_{i+1}}}\\
    \label{e:brtaylord}
    \frac{W_{fuel_i}}{W_{i+1}} &\geq z_{bre_i} + \frac{z_{bre_i}^2}{2} + \frac{z_{bre_i}^3}{6} + \frac{z_{bre_i}^3}{24} 
    \end{align}

    For evaluation of long-endurance, gas-powered aircraft a discretization of $N=5$ is used. 

\subsection{Steady Level Flight}

Both the gas and solar powered aircraft are assumed to be in steady level flight.  The balance of the main forces of lift, drag, weight and thrust are modeled as

\begin{align}
    \label{e:slfthrust}
    T &\geq \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_D S\\
    \label{e:slfweight}
    W &= \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_L S . 
\end{align}

The shaft power produced by the engine or motor and can expressed as  

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:slfpower}
    P_{\text{shaft}} = \frac{TV}{\eta_{prop}}
    \end{equation}

    where $\eta_{prop}$ is assumed to be a constant. Equations~\ref{e:slfthrust},~\ref{e:slfweight}, and~\ref{e:slfpower} are all monomials and therefore GP-compatible.

\subsection{Aerodynamics}

The aircraft aerodynamics is modeled as a drag build up of wing profile drag, induced drag, and non-wing drag coefficients, 

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:aerodragb}
    C_D \geq C_{d_0} + c_{d_p} + \frac{C_L}{\pi e A}.
    \end{equation}

    To estimate the wing profile drag, a posynomial fit is made of the drag polar of the \emph{JH01} airfoil. (See Appendix) 
    
    The drag polar was produced using XFOIL at a Reynolds number, $Re_{ref}=3e5$. 
    The posynomial fit is constructed using techniques described in Hoburg.\cite{fitting}
    A Reynolds number scaling is used to account for viscous effects.  \eqref{e:aerodragprof}
    The XFOIL drag polar data is compared to the posynomial fit in figure~\ref{f:JH01polar}.

    \begin{align}
        \label{e:aerodragprof}
        c_{d_p} &\geq (0.33C_L^{-0.0809} + 0.645C_L^{0.045} + 7.35e-5C_L^{12})^{(1/0.00544)} \left( \frac{Re}{Re_{ref}} \right)^{-0.4} \\
        Re &= \frac{\rho V S/b}{\mu}
    \end{align}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{JH01polar.pdf}
    \caption{ \textbf{ The posynomial fit (Equation~\ref{e:aerodragprof}) of the \emph{JH01} airfoil drag polar is represented as a solid line.  The open circles are the calculated drag polars from XFOIL at a reference Reynolds number of $Re=3e^5$. The maximum residual error, as defined in Hoburg\cite{fitting}, is 0.0026.} }
	\label{f:JH01polar}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Weight Breakdown}

The weight of each component of both the gas and solar platforms is summed to constrain the max take off weight.  In both aircraft, the structural weight is considered to be a fraction, $f_{\text{structural}}$, of the max take off weight, $MTOW$. (Equation~\ref{e:weightfst}) The structural weight comprises the weight of the wing, fuselage, horizontal and vertical stabilizer, and engine. The weight breakdown for the gas powered aircraft is a summation of the structural weight, the total fuel weight, and the payload weight. 

\begin{align}
    \label{e:weightmtow}
    MTOW &\geq W_{\text{structural}}  + W_{\text{payload}} + W_{\text{fuel}} \\
    \label{e:weightfst}
    W_{\text{structural}} &\geq f_{structural}MTOW
\end{align}

A similiar weight breakdown is done for the solar-electric powered aircraft, 

\begin{align}
    \label{e:weightsmtow}
    MTOW &\geq W_{\text{structural}} + W_{\text{payload}} + W_{\text{solar}} + W_{\text{battery}} \\
    W_{\text{structural}} &\geq f_{structural}MTOW \\
    W_{\text{solar}} &\geq \rho_{solar} S_{solar} g \\
    W_{\text{battery}} &\geq \frac{E_{\text{battery}}}{h_{\text{battery}}} g
\end{align}

% Because of limited information about these aircraft the optimization predictions are not exact.

\section{Long-endurance Aircraft Trade Space}

Using the models described in section III a comparison of the long-endurance trade space is achieved by comparing solar-electric and gas powered aircraft for different latitudes and altitudes and parameters. 
The parameters and inputs to the gas and solar powered models for each optimization solution are listed in Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams}.  \\

There are different altitude, latitude, endurance, and non-wing drag coefficient inputs for gas and solar-electric powered aircraft.. 
Gas powered aircraft are aspirated and therefore tend to operate at lower altitudes around 16,000 ft.  
Solar powered aircraft are more likely to operate around 50,000 ft where wind speeds are slower and cloud blockage is minimal. (Figure~\ref{f:windalt})
Each architecture is evaluated at the latitude where the wind speeds are the highest for their respective altitudes.  
For gas powered aircraft operating at 12,000 ft, the wind speeds peak at the 45th degree latitude. (Figure~\ref{f:latvswindh16}) 
For solar powered aircraft operating at 50,000 ft, the wind speeds peak at the 30th degree latitude. (Figure~\ref{f:latvswindh50})
The endurance requirement for gas powered aircraft is set at 8 days. 
Instead of a specific time requirement on the solar aircraft, it is constrained to fly during the winter solstice. 
If a solar aircraft can fly during the winter solstice, when there is the least amount of sunlight, then it could theoretically fly during any day of the year.  
It is assumed that gas powered aircraft will have a higher non-wing drag coefficient that a solar powered aircraft because a gasoline energy source will require a fuselage with a larger frontal area than a battery energy source.\cite{raymer}


\subsection{Operating at Different Latitudes}

An analysis of the max take off weight required to operate at different latitudes reveals that is it is more difficult for solar-electric powered aircraft to operate at higher wind speeds than it is for gas powered aircraft.
This analysis is achieved by minimizing the max take off weight in both the gas and solar-electric powered optimization models different latitudes, given the parameters listed in Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams}.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \begin{subfigmatrix}{2}% number of columns
     \subfigure[Gas Powered\label{f:latvsmtow}]{\includegraphics{latvsmtow.pdf}}
     \subfigure[Solar-Electric Powered\label{f:mtowvslatsolar}]{\includegraphics{mtowvslatsolar.pdf}}
 \end{subfigmatrix}
 \caption{\textbf{ Trade study of max take off weight and latitude. \ref{f:latvsmtow} shows the required max take off weight of gas powered aircraft for different latitude with an endurance requirement of 8 days.  \ref{f:mtowvslatsolar} shows the required max take off weight of solar-electric for different latitudes. Maximum correspond to the maximums in wind speed profiles. (Figure~\ref{f:windlat}) A comparison of the solar and gas powered latitude analysis shows that gas powered aircraft are more robust to operating in higher wind speeds. Results are valid for the parameters listed in Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams}.}}
 \label{f:latvsmtowtrade}
\end{figure}

Specifically, the analysis shows that while the required max take off weight for both solar and gas powered aircraft grow at higher latitudes, it is clear that, for the given set of constraints and parameters, solar-electric powered aircraft cannot operate in 90th percentile winds for latitudes above 30 degrees.  
The reason the max take off weight grows 35-45th degree latitudes for both the gas powered and solar powered aircraft is because the wind speeds are at a maximum at those latitudes. (Figure~\ref{f:windlat})
The higher wind speeds require more power and therefore more energy in the form of batteries or fuel.  
For solar-electric powered aircraft to reach these higher latitudes improved batteries, solar cells or structural efficiencies must be used. \\

Interestingly, there is a local minimum for solar powered aircraft at 42 degrees latitude.  As wind speeds decrease for latitudes greater than 35 degrees, there is a locally optimum latitude before the declination angle at the winter solstice makes it too difficult to harvest enough sunlight.

\section{Minimum Aircraft Weight}

Another important trade off for long-endurance aircraft is weight versus endurance. 
Put another way, for a given endurance requirement, what is the smallest aircraft that can be built?
Using the parameters listed in Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams} both the gas and the solar powered aircraft optimization models were solved to minimize max take off weight at the 85th percentile winds.  

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{solargasmtow.pdf}
    \caption{ \textbf{ A comparison between the minimum aircraft weight required of a solar and gas powered architecture to achieve the requirements in Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams}. The intersection of the solar and gas powered curves roughly represent which architecture would have a lower weight for a given endurance requirement. The horizontal line represent the minimum weight required to fly a solar powered aircraft for 24 hours during the winter solstice at a given latitude.}}
	\label{f:solargasmtow}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The minimum weight analysis shows that the minimum weight aircraft for an endurance greater than 10 days should be solar-electric powered.  This analysis quantifies for which endurance requirement is it advantageous to use a solar-electric powered architecture.

\subsection{Solar-electric Powered Trade Space Exploration}

For a broader picture of the design space the solar optimization is solved multiple times, producing a set of contour plots for various battery energy densities, structural fraction weights, altitudes, and availabilities.  (Figure~\ref{f:solarcontours}) 
The matrix contour plot map is a useful reference tool designed to give understanding to key trade offs in the solar-electric powered aircraft sizing problem.
Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams} lists the parameters that are fixed in the optimization for this trade study.

 \begin{figure}[H]

 \caption{ \textbf{Matrix of contour plots of battery energy density and structural weight fraction vs wing span for solar-electric powered aircraft. Each point on the graph corresponds to a unique design.} }
 \label{f:solarcontours}
\end{figure}

The effectiveness of geometric programming in analyzing and understanding key design trades off is demonstrated in the fact that all nine contour plots were generated in under 60 seconds. Each contour plot is created from 100 unique solutions to the geometric programming optimization model.  It takes approximately 5 seconds to generate 100 solutions on a standard laptop.

\section{Detailed Structural Models}

To improve the fidelity of the optimization, higher fidelity structural models can be implemented.  To demonstrate the capability to include higher fidelity models in GP optimization a discretized wing spar is considered. 
Similar to the constraints derived in Section III, a set of constraints governing the physical models of wing spar sizing are expressed in a GP-compatible form and added to the overall optimization model.  
This results in a more comprehensive and detailed optimization model for aircraft sizing.   \\

A simple approach to modeling a wing spar is to assume that the wing is a beam under bending loads caused by the lifting distribution along the wing and the weight of the aircraft. A conservative approach to calculating the size of the spar is to assume that the spar carries all of the bending loads.  It is commonly assumed that the wing loading distribution, $q$, scales with the local chord,\cite{bending}

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:wingloading}
    q(y) \approx K_q c(y) 
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the distance from the root wing location. The loading constant $K_q$\cite{bending} is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:kq}
    K_q = \frac{N_{max}W_{cent}}{S}
\end{equation}

where $W_{cent}$ is the sum of distributed loads acting at the center of the aircraft. The local chord for a constant tapered wing\cite{bending} is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:localchord}
    c(y) = \frac{S_{wing}}{b} \frac{2}{1+\lambda} \left( 1 + (\lambda - 1) \frac{2y}{b} \right)
\end{equation}

Using a standard Bernoulli-Euler discretized beam model with $n$ nodes, the shear forces and moments can be computed from the distributed loads with boundary conditions of zero shear forces and moments at the wing tips.\cite{bending}

\begin{align}
    \label{e:shear}
    \mathcal{S}_i &= \mathcal{S}_{i+1} - \frac{q_{i+1} + q_i}{2}\Delta y \\
    \label{e:moment}
    M_i &= M_{i+1} - \frac{\mathcal{S}_{i+1} + \mathcal{S}_i}{2}\Delta y \\
    \label{e:shearboundary}
    \mathcal{S}_n &= 0 \\
    \label{e:momentboundary}
    M_n &= 0
\end{align}

Similarly, the angle deflection and deflection can be calculated with boundary conditions of zero angle and deflection and the wing root.\cite{bending}

\begin{align}
    \label{e:angle}
    \Theta_{i} &= \Theta_{i+1} + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{M_i}{EI_i} + \frac{M_{i-1}}{EI_{i-1}} \right) \Delta y \\
    \label{e:deflection}
    w_{i} &= w_{i+1} + \frac{1}{2} (\Theta_i + \Theta_{i-1}) \Delta y \\
    \label{e:angleboundary}
    \Theta_0 &= 0 \\
    \label{e:defboundary}
    w_0 &= 0 \\
\end{align}
 
If the normalized distributed loads, $\bar{q}(y) = \frac{c(y)}{S/b}$ are computed prior to solving, then Equations~\ref{e:shear}-\ref{e:defboundary} are GP compatible and can be written as

\begin{align}
    \label{e:sheargp}
    \mathcal{S}_{i+1} &\geq \mathcal{S}_i + \frac{q_{i+1} + q_i}{2} \Delta y \\
    \label{e:momentgp}
    M_{i+1} &= M_i + \frac{\mathcal{S}_{i+1} + \mathcal{S}_i}{2} \Delta y \\
    \label{e:anglegp}
    \Theta_{i} &\geq \Theta_{i+1} + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{M_i}{EI_i} + \frac{M_{i-1}}{EI_{i-1}} \right) \Delta y \\
    \label{e:deflection}
    w_{i} &\geq w_{i+1} + \frac{1}{2} (\Theta_i + \Theta_{i-1}) \Delta y 
\end{align}

For this example a cap spar will be considered.  A cap spar has two carbon fiber caps separated by a foam core as seen in figure~\ref{f:capspar}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{capspar.pdf}
    \caption{ \textbf{ Cross sectional view of a cap spar.  The two caps are made of carbon fiber, separated by a foam core.}}
	\label{f:capspar}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The moment of inertia of the cap spar is modeled by only considering the spar caps, not the foam interior.  
This conservative assumption is made because the contribution of the foam core is much less than that of the spar caps.  
The equation for the moment of inertia\cite{bending} of a cap spar is 

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:moispar}
    I = \frac{w_{\text{cap}}t_{\text{cap}}^3}{6} 2w_{\text{cap}}t_{\text{cap}}\left( \frac{h_{\text{cap}}}{2} + \frac{t_{\text{cap}}}{2} \right)^2
\end{equation}

This equation is not GP compatible.  However, using a first order conservative approximation, the moment of inertia can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:moispar}
    I \leq 2w_{\text{cap}}t_{\text{cap}}\left(\frac{h_{\text{cap}}}{2}\right)^2
\end{equation}

There are also geometric constraints imposed on the width and thickness.  The total spar cap thickness cannot be greater than the thickness of the airfoil cross section.  The width of the spar cap is assumed by no greater than some percentage of chord.

\begin{align}
    \label{e:thickness}
    c\tau_t &\geq h_{\text{cap}} + 2t_{\text{cap}} \\
    \label{e:width}
    c\tau_w &\geq w_{\text{cap}} \\
    \end{align}

Generally, a wing is either stress or deflection constrained. Meaning, the wing spar at the root must be strong enough to withstand the bending root moment and stiff enough to not exceed some deflection limit.  Both constraints can be imposed in the optimization model as

\begin{align}
    \label{e:stresscont}
    \sigma_{\text{carbon fiber}} &\geq M_0 \frac{h_{\text{cap}}+t_{\text{cap}}}{I}\\
    \label{e:defcont}
    w_n &\leq \left(\frac{w_{max}}{b} \right) b.
\end{align}

Finally, the weight of the spar cap is computed as

\begin{align}
    \label{e:sparmass}
    \Delta W_i &\geq \rho_{\text{carbon fiber}} w_{\text{cap}_i}t_{\text{cap}_i} \frac{b}{n-1}g \\
    \label{e:sparmasssum}
    W &\geq \sum\limits_{1}^{n-1} \Delta W_i
\end{align}

This cap model is added to the gas-powered long endurance aircraft optimization model and solved by minimizing the max take off weight.  In addition to the parameters listed in Table~\ref{t:gassolarparams}, the parameters in Table~\ref{t:sparparams} were used to solve the optimization model.  \\

Incorporation of the wing spar model into the gas powered, long-endurance optimization model demonstrates how higher fidelity models can be added to the optimization model to achieve a more detailed design.  
To design a complete long-endurance aircraft as a GP more detailed models for the fuselage, empennage, engine and wing can be added to the optimization mode via a similar process as the cap spar model. A structural fraction weight would no longer be needed and a more accurate vehicle optimization could be achieved.
 
\section{Conclusion}

Using geometric programming as a form of evaluation of the design space, high level intuition and understanding about design trade studies for long-endurance aircraft and their driving requirements is achieved.  
One high level discovery is the important of wind speed.  
If keeping position at all times during the flight is critical to the mission of a proposed aircraft, then that requirement is more likely to be met by a gas-powered architecture.
However, if that constraint can be relaxed such that the aircraft only needs to station keep for 80\% of then time, then for certain latitudes, a solar powered aircraft could achieve greater endurance.
Another unsurprising discovery is the sensitivity of the solar-powered aircraft to the battery energy density and solar cell efficiency.  Using higher energy density batteries can result in significant weight and performance savings.  
The rapid solve time of geometric programming is able to present these trade studies and give intuition into design trades by quantifying the disparity in performance between two options.
While the results of these findings are dependent on the accuracy of the models used in the optimization, it is shown that higher fidelity models can be incorporated to increase accuracy.

\subsection{Discussion on the use of the \emph{JH01} airfoil}

The \emph{sd7032} airfoil was redesigned to prevent drag creep by weakening the pressure spike associated with premature separation at higher Reynolds numbers.  
Figure~\ref{f:jhcps} shows the a pressure distribution generated in XFOIL of the \emph{JH01} airfoil at $C_L=0.0$ and $C_L=1.35$ with $Re=3e5$.
The redesigned airfoil was named \emph{JH01}. We would like to thank Mark Drela who helped in the redesign.
